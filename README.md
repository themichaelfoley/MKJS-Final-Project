# Abstract 
Our Final Project focuses on creating an NFT Marketplace based on club membership. Our main purpose was to create an exclusive club in which members could register NFT's as a way to become members of our club. Once an individual becomes a member, they are able to bid on different NFT's to gain a higher status within the club community. 
# How Did We Perform This? 
We started by creating a Smart Contract which allowed us to launch a Streamlit Application in which Members could register all of their NFT Artwork using Pinata. Two Separate contracts were created which consisted on the bidding portion of our club. Finally, we created a Token Wallet which allowed Members to purchase amenities within the club (Alcohol, Cannabis).
# Future Enhancements 
Our project components were separated due to time constraints; however, we would have liked to combine all of them and eventually launch a Streamlit application that allows Members to register NFT's, bid on NFT's, and use their wallets to make purchases within the club.
